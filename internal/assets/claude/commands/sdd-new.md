description: Start a new SDD change — runs exploration then creates a proposal
---

If the native `sdd-orchestrator` agent is available, delegate this command to it.
Otherwise, follow the SDD orchestrator workflow inline using the instructions already installed in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

WORKFLOW:
1. Launch `sdd-explore` to investigate the codebase for this change
2. Present the exploration summary to the user
3. Launch `sdd-propose` to create a proposal based on the exploration
4. Present the proposal summary and ask the user if they want to continue with specs and design

CONTEXT:
- Working directory: !`echo -n "$(pwd)"`
- Current project: !`echo -n "$(basename $(pwd))"`
- Change name: $ARGUMENTS
- Execution mode: ask/cache per orchestrator
- Artifact store mode: ask/cache per orchestrator
- Delivery strategy: ask/cache per orchestrator

ENGRAM NOTE:
Sub-agents handle persistence automatically. Each phase saves its artifact to engram with topic_key "sdd/$ARGUMENTS/{type}".

Read the orchestrator instructions to coordinate this workflow. Do NOT execute phase work inline when a native sub-agent is available.
