All agents receive the **full SDD orchestrator** policy, plus skill files written to their skills directory. Most agents receive it through their system prompt; OpenCode and Kilo Code receive it through the OpenCode-compatible `opencode.json` agent overlay. The agent handles SDD automatically when the task is large enough, or when the user explicitly asks for it — no manual setup required.

## Delegation Models

| Model                 | How It Works                                                                                                                         | Agents                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full (sub-agents)** | Each SDD phase runs in an isolated context window via native sub-agent delegation or an OpenCode-compatible overlay. The orchestrator coordinates; sub-agents execute. | Claude Code, OpenCode, Kilo Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Kimi Code, Kiro IDE, Qwen Code |
| **Solo-agent**        | All SDD phases run inline in the same conversation. The orchestrator IS the executor. Engram provides cross-phase persistence.       | Codex, Windsurf, Antigravity, OpenClaw                           |

### Cursor Native Subagents

Cursor uses its built-in `.cursor/agents/` system. `gentle-ai` writes 10 agent files to `~/.cursor/agents/sdd-{phase}.md` — one per SDD phase. Cursor's Agent auto-delegates to the correct subagent based on the `description` field in each file's YAML frontmatter.

- `sdd-explore` and `sdd-verify` run with `readonly: false` so they can inspect the codebase and execute verification commands
- Each subagent gets its own context window (fresh context, no pollution)
- The orchestrator resolves compact rules from the skill registry and passes them in the invocation message

### Windsurf Cascade

Windsurf runs as a solo-agent (no custom sub-agents). The orchestrator leverages Windsurf-native features:

- **Plan Mode** — creates persistent plan documents that can be @mentioned across sessions; ideal for spec and design artifacts on large changes
- **Code Mode** — default agentic execution mode
- **Native Workflows** — `sdd-new` is available as a `.windsurf/workflows/sdd-new.md` workflow
- **Size Classification** — the orchestrator routes tasks through Small/Medium/Large decision paths

### Antigravity + Mission Control

Antigravity is an agent-first platform with built-in sub-agents (Browser, Terminal) managed by Mission Control. However, custom sub-agent creation is not yet available. SDD phases run inline, with Mission Control handling automatic delegation to built-in sub-agents when specialized tooling is needed (e.g., Browser for research during `sdd-explore`).

### Kiro Native Subagents

Kiro uses native custom agents in `~/.kiro/agents/`. `gentle-ai` writes 10 phase agents (`sdd-init` through `sdd-onboard`) and resolves the `model:` field during injection from Claude alias assignments (`opus|sonnet|haiku`) to Kiro-native model IDs.

- Frontmatter includes `includeMcpJson: true` for all phase agents
- Phase-specific tools are preserved (`sdd-explore` and `sdd-verify` use read/shell/context7 as required)
- Orchestrator remains in steering (`~/.kiro/steering/gentle-ai.md`) and delegates execution to native subagents

## SDD Mode Support

| Feature | Claude Code | OpenCode | Kilo Code | Gemini CLI | Cursor | VS Code Copilot | Codex | Windsurf | Antigravity | Kiro IDE | Qwen Code | OpenClaw |
|---------|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------:|:---------------:|:-----:|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| SDD orchestrator | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Single-mode SDD | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-mode SDD | — | Yes | Yes | — | — | — | — | — | — | Yes* | — | — |

**Multi-mode** (assigning different AI models to each SDD phase) is supported by **OpenCode** and **Kilo Code** through the OpenCode-compatible multi-mode overlay, and by **Kiro IDE** through native subagent `model:` frontmatter. All other agents run in **single-mode** — the orchestrator manages everything using whatever model the agent is already running.

> \* **Kiro multi-mode** assigns models per phase through `KiroModelAssignments` (configured via *Configure Models → Configure Kiro models* in the TUI). The selected alias (`opus|sonnet|haiku`) is resolved to a Kiro-native model ID and stamped into each `~/.kiro/agents/sdd-{phase}.md` at sync time.

## Agent Notes

### Claude Code

- Sub-agents via the native Task tool with isolated context windows
- MCP servers configured as plugins in `~/.claude/mcp/`
- Output styles in `~/.claude/output-styles/`
- System prompt via markdown sections in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

### OpenCode

- Full multi-agent overlay with 11 named agents in `opencode.json` (`gentle-orchestrator` plus 10 SDD phase agents)
- Slash commands for SDD phases (`/sdd-new`, `/sdd-explore`, etc.)
- Background-agents plugin for parallel execution
- Multi-mode prerequisite: connect your AI providers first, then run `opencode models --refresh`

### Kilo Code

- **Detection**: gentle-ai detects Kilo Code from `~/.config/kilo` and checks for the `kilo` binary on `PATH`
- Uses the OpenCode-compatible adapter: `AGENTS.md`, `skills/`, `commands/`, and `opencode.json` live under `~/.config/kilo`
- Full SDD delegation is provided by the merged multi-agent overlay in `~/.config/kilo/opencode.json`, not by a separate native sub-agent directory
- MCP servers are merged into `opencode.json`; Engram uses the OpenCode-style local MCP entry with `command` as an array
- Auto-install is supported via npm: `npm install -g @kilocode/cli`

### Gemini CLI

- Sub-agents are experimental: require `experimental.enableAgents: true` in `settings.json`
- Custom sub-agents defined as markdown files in `~/.gemini/agents/`

### Cursor
- Native subagents via `~/.cursor/agents/sdd-{phase}.md` (10 files installed by gentle-ai)
- Skills at `~/.cursor/skills/`
- System prompt in `~/.cursor/rules/gentle-ai.mdc`
- MCP config in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

### VS Code Copilot

- Uses the `runSubagent` tool with support for parallel execution
- Skills at `~/.copilot/skills/`
- System prompt at `Code/User/prompts/gentle-ai.instructions.md`
- MCP config at `Code/User/mcp.json`

### Codex

- CLI-native agent with TOML config at `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Skills at `~/.codex/skills/`
- System prompt at `~/.codex/agents.md`
- Engram instruction files at `~/.codex/engram-instructions.md`

### Windsurf

- Skills at `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/` (native Windsurf feature)
- MCP config at `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- Global rules at `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md`
- Workflows at `.windsurf/workflows/` (workspace-scoped)

### Antigravity

- Skills at `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` (native Antigravity feature)
- MCP config at `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`
- System prompt appended to `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` (shared with Gemini CLI — collision check warns if both are installed)
- Mission Control handles built-in sub-agent delegation (Browser, Terminal) automatically
- Settings managed via the IDE's Agent settings UI, not via `settings.json`

### Kimi Code

- Installation requires the `uv` Python package manager (`uv tool install kimi-cli`).
- Root custom agent at `~/.kimi/agents/gentleman.yaml` with `system_prompt_path: ../KIMI.md`
- `KIMI.md` is a thin Jinja template that includes modular prompt files:
  `persona.md`, `output-style.md`, `engram-protocol.md`, `sdd-orchestrator.md`
- Built-in Kimi variables are preserved in `KIMI.md`: `${KIMI_AGENTS_MD}` and `${KIMI_SKILLS}`

### Kiro IDE

- **Detection**: gentle-ai detects Kiro from the `kiro` binary on `PATH`; when the binary is present, it also reports whether `~/.kiro` already exists. A config directory alone does not mark Kiro as installed.
- **Steering file** (all platforms): `~/.kiro/steering/gentle-ai.md` with frontmatter `inclusion: always`
- Native subagents at `~/.kiro/agents/sdd-{phase}.md` (10 files)
- Skills (all platforms) at `~/.kiro/skills/`
- **MCP config at a separate root** — always `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.kiro\settings\mcp.json` (Windows), regardless of GlobalConfigDir
- Native Kiro specs workflow: `.kiro/specs/<feature>/requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` — with approval gates before apply and archive phases
- Manual install only — download from [kiro.dev/downloads](https://kiro.dev/downloads)
- See [docs/kiro.md](kiro.md) for full path reference and SDD behavior details

### Qwen Code
- **Detection**: gentle-ai detects Qwen Code from its config root (`~/.qwen`) and checks for `qwen` binary on `PATH`
- **Config root**: `~/.qwen/` (cross-platform)
- **System prompt**: `~/.qwen/QWEN.md` (managed via `StrategyFileReplace`)
- **Skills**: `~/.qwen/skills/`
- **MCP config**: `~/.qwen/settings.json` (managed via `StrategyMergeIntoSettings` with `mcpServers` key)
- **Slash commands**: `~/.qwen/commands/*.md` — supports custom namespaced slash commands (e.g., `commands/sdd/init.md` → `/sdd:init`)
- **Permissions**: `auto_edit` mode — auto-approves file edits, manual approval for shell commands
- **Install**: via npm — `npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest`
- **Engram slug**: `"qwen-code"` for `engram setup` integration
- **SDD orchestrator**: `internal/assets/qwen/sdd-orchestrator.md` with Qwen-specific path references

### OpenClaw

- **Detection**: gentle-ai detects OpenClaw from the `openclaw` binary on `PATH` and its config root at `~/.openclaw`.
- **Install**: manual only — install OpenClaw first, then run `gentle-ai install --agent openclaw`.
- **Active workspace**: gentle-ai reads `agents.defaults.workspace` from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and writes instruction files there.
- **Instructions**: Engram and SDD protocols are injected into workspace `AGENTS.md`; persona is injected into workspace `SOUL.md`.
- **MCP config**: Engram and Context7 are merged into global `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `mcp.servers`; legacy root `mcpServers` entries are migrated.
- **Skills**: SDD phase skills are workspace-scoped at `<workspace>/.openclaw/skills/sdd-*`; portable skills remain global at `~/.openclaw/skills/`.
